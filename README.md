The code aims to train a pre-trained model to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the workplace using the Ultralytics YOLO object detection framework.

- The code assumes that you have a CUDA-enabled GPU. If not, it will automatically use the CPU for computation. You can check the device being used in the console output.
